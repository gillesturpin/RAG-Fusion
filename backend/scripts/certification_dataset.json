    {
      "question": "Explain how task decomposition contributes to problem-solving in LangChain and describe two specific ways it enables more complex reasoning in AI applications.",
      "ground_truth": "Task decomposition breaks large, complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks, which is crucial for AI agents handling multi-step queries. In LangChain, this technique allows language models to systematically approach complex problems by breaking them down into discrete steps, enabling more sophisticated reasoning and processing across different types of tasks.",

      "question": "What is the estimated potential ROI for Ubisoft's proposed multi-platform premium strategy with multilingual support?",
      "ground_truth": "Based on the analysis, the proposed premium multi-platform strategy with multilingual support could generate 3-5x more engagement compared to Ubisoft's current average. This significant potential increase in engagement would justify the strategic investment in these proposed approaches.",

      "question": "What are the three key steps in the immediate action plan for developing a new game strategy?",
      "ground_truth": "The immediate action plan involves three critical steps: 1) Validating the concept on identified Racing/Sports segments, 2) Developing a multi-platform approach from the initial design stage, and 3) Ensuring localization in a minimum of 6 languages.",

      "ground_truth": "The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run on push and pull request events for main and develop branches. The test job runs on Ubuntu and includes steps to checkout code, setup Node.js version 16, install dependencies using npm ci, run tests with npm test, and build the project using npm run build.",

      "ground_truth": "The analysis suggests a premium multi-platform strategy with multilingual support could generate 3-5x more engagement compared to Ubisoft's current average. This positioning would justify strategic investments in developing a competitive ecosystem against Valve. The estimated return on investment indicates significant potential for enhanced market performance.",

      "ground_truth": "When using interactive rebase, you can modify commits by replacing 'pick' with different commands. 'reword' allows changing the commit message, 'edit' enables modifying the commit itself, 'squash' merges the commit with the previous one, and 'drop' removes the commit entirely from the history.",

      "question": "Describe the sequence of Git commands used to create and push a new feature branch with multiple commits in this workflow.",
      "ground_truth": "The workflow involves creating a new feature branch and making multiple commits with specific messages. The developer creates new files (login.js and logout.js), modifies an existing file (main.py), stages and commits each change with descriptive commit messages, and then pushes the branch to GitHub using 'git push -u origin feature/nouvelle-fonction'.",

      "ground_truth": "The Steam market analysis project consists of four phases: Phase 1 (Exploration of Data) involves examining the Steam dataset structure, verifying data quality, and understanding platform evolution. Phase 2 (Data Preparation) focuses on extracting nested data like platforms and prices, cleaning data, and initial price distribution analysis. Phase 3 (Macro Analyses) covers competitive positioning of publishers, market trends, promotion strategies, and localization factors. Phase 4 (Genre Analysis) examines dominant game genres, publisher specializations, and pricing strategies by genre.",

If no start_index is specified, the slice defaults to index 0, and if no end_index is specified, the slice will extend to the last index of the list.",
