      "question": "Describe the key components of defining a function in Python and explain the purpose of the 'return' statement in function implementation.",
      "answer": "Based on the course materials, I can now provide a comprehensive answer addressing both parts of the question.\n\n## Key Components of Defining a Function in Python:\n\nAccording to the course materials, the key components of defining a function are:\n\n1. **The `def` keyword**: Functions are declared using `def` followed by the function name\n2. **Function name**: Following the syntax `def name_of_the_function`\n3. **Arguments/Parameters**: Specified in parentheses - functions can take single or multiple arguments. As shown in the materials: `def name_of_the_function(x, y, z):` for multi-argument functions, or `def square_number(number):` for single-argument functions\n4. **Function body**: The code/instructions that execute when the function is called (indicated by `### CODE` in the syntax examples)\n5. **Return statement (optional)**: As noted, \"the declaration of the function can end with a `return` instruction\"\n\n## Purpose of the 'return' Statement:\n\nThe `return` statement \"allows the result of the calculation to be retrieved from the function and reused later in the code.\" As the materials explain with an example: \"If you want to retrieve the result of the calculation to reuse it later, you have to add a 'return'.\" When a function has a return statement, you can capture the returned value by writing `res = function_name(argument)`, allowing you to reuse that result elsewhere in your code, such as in the example where the returned value is used in a calculation: `res+1`.",
      "ground_truth": "A Python function starts with the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name and arguments in parentheses. After declaring the function, you must indent the code block containing the instructions to be executed. The optional 'return' statement allows you to output a result that can be reused outside the function, enabling more flexible and modular code.",

The example `garage1 = Garage(3, 2, 1, 1)` creates a garage with 3 employees, 2 clients, 1 car to repair, and 1 car already repaired.",

The course emphasizes that \"you will be reading code more often than you will be writing it,\" so following standards like DRY and writing elegantly with functions makes code more readable and better structured, just as \"you wouldn't like to read a novel that has been badly written, no one likes to read badly structured code.\"",

The command is used with the syntax `git commit -m \"text describing the changes you made\"`, where the message describes what changes were made. This creates a checkpoint in your project's history that can later be referenced using `git log` to view all commits, or `git reset` to restore a specific version of your project. In the workflow, commits are later pushed to the remote repository using `git push` to share your saved changes with others.",

      "question": "What problem does a Version Control System (VCS) like Git solve when managing software project files?",
      "answer": "Based on the course materials, a Version Control System (VCS) like Git solves several key problems when managing software project files:\n\n1. **Collaboration challenges**: The course explicitly states that \"Writing code together on the same project can be a nightmare if you don't know how to do it,\" and a VCS provides the solution for efficient collaboration on software development projects.\n\n2. **Version management and history tracking**: Git allows you to \"manage code versions\" and \"keep history of the different versions of the files.\" Through commits, which act like \"flags,\" you can go back to specific versions of a file at any time, and use `git log` to see all the history of changes you've made.\n\n3. **File change tracking**: Git enables you to track changes in files systematically. You can see which files have been created, modified, or deleted, and restore previous versions of your project using `git reset` to go back to any saved commit.\n\n4. **Code preservation**: The `git push` command allows you to \"have a remote copy in the cloud of all the changes you've made, such that you will never lose your code, even if your computer crashes.\"",
      "ground_truth": "A Version Control System solves the problem that writing code together on the same project can be a nightmare without proper tools. Git allows developers to manage code versions systematically and collaborate efficiently, avoiding the chaos of manually exchanging files between collaborators. It enables automatic version tracking through commits, which act as flags allowing you to go back to specific versions at any time without losing or breaking the initial code.",
