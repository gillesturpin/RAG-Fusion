      "question": "What are three key learning objectives for this Git and Github collaboration course?",
      "ground_truth": "The course aims to teach learners the basics of Git as a Version Control System, how to use Git with the terminal and share code on Github, and how to collaborate on development projects using the agile method. These objectives will help developers effectively manage code versions and work together on software projects.",

    {
      "question": "What method can be used to display the current state of a Garage instance, and what specific attributes will be printed?",
      "ground_truth": "The display_information() method prints details about a Garage instance, including the number of employees, clients, cars to repair, and cars already repaired. This method uses print() statements to output the values of self.employees, self.clients, self.cars_to_repair, and self.cars_repaired.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the key components of defining a function in Python and explain the purpose of the 'return' statement in function implementation.",
      "ground_truth": "A Python function starts with the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name and arguments in parentheses. After declaring the function, you must indent the code block containing the instructions to be executed. The optional 'return' statement allows you to output a result that can be reused outside the function, enabling more flexible and modular code.",

      "question": "How can you create an instance of the Garage class, and what attributes can be specified during initialization?",
      "ground_truth": "A Garage class instance can be created in two ways: either by calling Garage() with no arguments (which sets all attributes to 0), or by calling Garage() with specific values for employees, clients, cars to repair, and cars repaired. When initialized with values like Garage(4, 2, 3, 1), the instance will have 4 employees, 2 clients, 3 cars to repair, and 1 car already repaired.",

    {
      "question": "How can you incorporate code snippets into a Markdown document, and provide an example of how to do this specifically for a Python code block?",
      "ground_truth": "To add code to a Markdown document, you use three counter-apostrophes (backticks) before and after your code block. For a Python code block, you would first open with three backticks followed by 'python', then write your code, and close with three more backticks. An example would be adding a simple Python for loop that prints 'hello world'.",

    {
      "question": "Explain why developers might use a Version Control System (VCS) like Git, and provide a concrete example of version management challenges without such a system.",
      "ground_truth": "A Version Control System helps developers collaborate efficiently on software development projects and manage code versions systematically. Without a VCS, writing code together on the same project can be a nightmare, as developers would need to exchange files from machine to machine between collaborators. Git allows automatic version tracking through commits (flags that allow you to go back to specific versions), enabling multiple people to work on the same code while keeping a stable version safe.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the purpose of functions in programming and how they help developers write more efficient code according to the DRY principle.",
      "ground_truth": "Functions allow developers to write a sequence of instructions once and then reuse them multiple times, which supports the 'Don't Repeat Yourself' (DRY) principle. By creating functions, programmers can store a set of instructions that can be called whenever needed, making code more elegant and easier to read. Functions help reduce code repetition and improve overall code structure and maintainability.",

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'git commit' command, and what specific action does it perform in the version control workflow?",
      "ground_truth": "The 'git commit' command creates a new commit that reports changes made in files that were previously 'added' using 'git add'. A commit acts like a 'flag' or snapshot that allows you to go back to a specific version of a file at any time, serving as a way to track and record the project's version history.",

      "question": "In the provided code for sharing an addition, what specific exceptions are being handled and what scenarios trigger each exception?",
      "ground_truth": "The code handles two specific exceptions: ValueError and ZeroDivisionError. The ValueError occurs when the user inputs something other than a number for the bill total or number of guests, while the ZeroDivisionError is triggered when the user enters zero as the number of guests, which would cause a division by zero error.",

      "question": "What problem does a Version Control System (VCS) like Git solve when managing software project files?",
      "ground_truth": "A Version Control System solves the problem that writing code together on the same project can be a nightmare without proper tools. Git allows developers to manage code versions systematically and collaborate efficiently, avoiding the chaos of manually exchanging files between collaborators. It enables automatic version tracking through commits, which act as flags allowing you to go back to specific versions at any time without losing or breaking the initial code.",
